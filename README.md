Augmented Reality with Live Video Stream
This project is a comprehensive implementation of Augmented Reality (AR) that overlays 3D models or images onto a live video stream. Developed as part of our Computer Vision Subject Project, it showcases the integration of modern AR techniques, including feature detection, feature matching, and real-time augmentation.

🌟 Key Features
Feature Detection:
Leveraged advanced algorithms like SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) or ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) for detecting key points in the image or video.
Feature Matching:
Implemented robust matching techniques, such as FLANN-based matching and brute-force matching, to accurately map features between the input image and the live video feed.
3D Model Augmentation:
Seamlessly integrated 3D models into the live video stream, anchored using matched features for a realistic AR experience.
Picture Augmentation:
Ability to overlay 2D images on real-world surfaces detected in the video.
Real-Time Processing:
Optimized for performance, ensuring smooth and responsive AR rendering.
🔧 Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
OpenCV: For image processing and computer vision tasks.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
PyOpenGL (optional): For rendering 3D models.
Tools: Camera calibration and matrix transformations for accurate augmentation.
🚀 How It Works
The user provides a reference image or real-time video stream as input.
The software detects and extracts features from the input image and the live video stream.
Matches the features between the input and live stream using feature-matching algorithms.
Augments a 3D model or 2D image at the detected feature locations in the live video stream.
🎯 Applications
AR Learning Tools: Interactive educational aids.
Gaming: Immersive AR experiences.
Virtual Product Placement: Realistic previews for marketing and advertising.
Prototyping: Overlaying design concepts in a real-world setting.
