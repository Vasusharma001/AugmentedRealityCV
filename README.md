# Augmented Reality with Live Video Stream  

This project implements **Augmented Reality (AR)** by overlaying 3D models or images onto a live video stream, developed as part of our **Computer Vision Subject Project**. The project focuses on key AR techniques like **feature detection**, **feature matching**, and **real-time augmentation**, demonstrating a seamless blend of computer vision and AR technology.

## 🌟 Key Features  
- **Feature Detection**  
  - Utilizes advanced algorithms like SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) or ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) to detect key points in an image or video stream.  
- **Feature Matching**  
  - Implements matching techniques, including FLANN-based matching and brute-force matching, to accurately identify and map features between input images and live video.  
- **3D Model Augmentation**  
  - Allows for anchoring 3D models into the live video stream at matched feature points, creating a realistic AR effect.  
- **Picture Augmentation**  
  - Supports overlaying 2D images on detected real-world surfaces in the video stream.  
- **Real-Time Processing**  
  - Optimized for responsive AR rendering with minimal latency.

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**  
  - **OpenCV**: For image processing and computer vision tasks  
  - **NumPy**: For numerical computations  
  - **PyOpenGL** (optional): For rendering 3D models  
- **Tools**: Camera calibration and matrix transformations for accurate feature alignment

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. The user provides a reference image or initiates a real-time video stream.  
2. The software detects and extracts features from both the input image and live video stream.  
3. Matching is performed between features of the input image and live stream using feature-matching algorithms.  
4. Based on matched features, a 3D model or 2D image is anchored at detected feature points in the live video stream.

## 🎯 Applications  
- **AR Learning Tools**: Interactive, educational aids for enhanced learning experiences  
- **Gaming**: Immersive AR gameplay experiences  
- **Virtual Product Placement**: Realistic product previews for advertising  
- **Prototyping**: Overlaying design concepts in a real-world setting
